Nashville Numbers
=================

A web app to create and share quick lead sheets (musical structures that
describe the harmony at any given time) inspired by the Nashville Numbers
system. WIP

Changelog
---------

v0.0.1 => First master version (not ready for release).
- General implementation of sheets, an editor, friendships, hubs and
  relationships between all those resources.
- Overal raw design. Improvements needed are the grid system and vertical
  alignment.
