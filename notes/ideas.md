Quick Ideas
===========

- Offer a 'create a quick sheet without logging in' option
- Offer a free month of PRO when posting about NN on FB with custom message
- Have sheet "pro's" that upload GOOD sheets public sheets in exchange for
  discount
- Have an upvote system for sheet quality's, sort by upvote when exploring
  sheets, put star next to official sheeters.
  They also have the power to put a stamp of approval on existing sheets
- Have a points system with statuses, like "executive general note parser" :D,
  (see PointSystem.md)
- Add the ability to make playlists (maybe even with a next button)
- In Hubs, make a setlist and get to play those sheets in order


Marketing
=========

Marketing will be solely word to mouth. I will stimulate this by in the
following ways:

- You can invite friends to go pro by giving them a code (your userID). When
  that user updates it's plan to pro, you get a free month!
- Give a free month to many popular session musicians, aka Ronald, Eric, Pat,
  JP-Bouvet and give them each 5 codes they can distribute for 1 month free
  coupons. Each one of those people get three more?
- Have people, as stated above, create quality sheets and post them on FB in
  exchange for discounts!
- Encourage people to post on the fb website, earning them points.
- For a 1000 points, you get a free month.
