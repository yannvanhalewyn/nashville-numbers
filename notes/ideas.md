Quick Ideas
===========

- Offer a 'create a quick sheet without logging in' option
- Offer a free month of PRO when posting about NN on FB with custom message
- Have sheet "pro's" that upload GOOD sheets public sheets in exchange for
  discount
- Have an upvote system for sheet quality's, sort by upvote when exploring
  sheets, put star next to official sheeters.
  They also have the power to put a stamp of approval on existing sheets
- Have a points system with statuses, like "executive general note parser" :D,
  (see PointSystem.md)
- Add the ability to make playlists (maybe even with a next button)
- In Hubs, make a setlist and get to play those sheets in order
- Add ability to 'fork' an existing public readonly sheet // Actually that's a bad idea.
- Think of names for the permissions in a hub. A peasant can't do anything, a
  lord can edit, a king can edit, add and delete sheets and a God can do anything,
  even manage people's permissions, rename the hub and rule the world.
- When in a HUB, you can have either self made sheets, or ref an existing public
  sheet! (warn the user that if the public sheet's owner updates it, it will
  affect the hub, maybe offer a lock of some sort?)
- Abitity to favorite (or like) an existing public sheet for easy referal


Marketing
=========

Marketing will be solely word to mouth. I will stimulate this by in the
following ways:

- You can invite friends to go pro by giving them a code (your userID). When
  that user updates it's plan to pro, you get a free month!
- Give a free month to many popular session musicians, aka Ronald, Eric, Pat,
  JP-Bouvet and give them each 5 codes they can distribute for 1 month free
  coupons. Each one of those people get three more?
- Have people, as stated above, create quality sheets and post them on FB in
  exchange for discounts!
- Encourage people to post on the fb website, earning them points.
- For a 1000 points, you get a free month.
